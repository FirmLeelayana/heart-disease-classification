# Heart Disease Detection project using Machine Learning
The project uses a publically available dataset for heart disease in patients to train a logistic regression model (written from scratch) in order to predict future cases of heart disease.

Notes:
- Using freely given data on heart disease, the code uses a logistic regression model to train itself in order to predict future heart disease cases.
- All data are mean-deducted as well as normalised to values between 0 - 1 to allow for quicker training
- 60/20/20 train/cross validation/test split for data
- Final model has high accuracy
- More data is required to determine if the model is overfitted.
- A prediction function is written for future cases, and gives a value based on the data given. 0 being no heart disease, 1 being heart disease is detected.
